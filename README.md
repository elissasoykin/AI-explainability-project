# Machine Learning Research Project

Here, you will find the research project I worked on at UCLA's Medical and Imaging Informatics department. This research focused on machine learning—specifically, on what techniques can be used to explain a machine learning model’s particular output or overall behavior. This is known as explainability in AI, and is a new and emerging field. I studied various methods, and then created a decision tree, table, and taxonomy to classify explainability techniques and to help people choose the most appropriate one for their situation.
